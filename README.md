This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Firebase JavaScript SDK: handling connection errors. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows an example of how a connection error might manifest, leading to unexpected behavior. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution using error handling and optional chaining to gracefully handle these scenarios. This approach prevents crashes, improves user experience, and simplifies debugging.
